# DemiScript

A direct transcription and annotation viewer for IIIF documents, created by Koray Birenheide for the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt.

A sandbox and finished DemiScript projects can be found on http://demiscript.de

The folder **/DemiScript** contains the demiscript.js library. Files with "sandbox" in their name are merely examples for implementation.

The folder **/project_template** contains an example static website, which utilizes the demiscript.js library and a demidoc.json overlay file. It has been streamlined for ease of implementation.
